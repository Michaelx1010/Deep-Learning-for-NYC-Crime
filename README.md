# Deep Learning for Violent Crime Prediction in NYC

## Project Overview
This project leverages advanced deep learning techniques to forecast violent crime rates in New York City. By utilizing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) networks, the project aims to enhance the precision of crime predictions and inform strategic policy making for enhanced public safety.

## Data Description
The dataset includes time-series data of violent crimes in NYC from 2007 to 2022, focusing on different types of offenses. The data undergoes thorough cleaning, normalization, and segmentation into training and testing sets to ensure high-quality inputs for model training.

## Models Used
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**
- **Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)**
- **Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)**
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**

Each model type is tailored to address the complex patterns and dependencies of crime data, with a special emphasis on overcoming challenges such as the vanishing gradient problem.

## Data Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning**: Removal of duplicates, handling of missing values, and outlier management.
- **Data Visualization**: Time-series analysis to identify crime trends over time.
- **Data Segmentation**: Weekly aggregation of data to reduce noise and computational load.

## Results
The project showcases the capabilities of deep learning models to outperform traditional statistical methods, with the BiLSTM model demonstrating the most accurate and reliable predictions. Results are detailed in the respective sections for each model type, along with comparisons and evaluations based on RMSE metrics.
